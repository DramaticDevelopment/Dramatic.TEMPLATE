SHORT DESCRIPTION
	A boilerplate for Victor's PowerShell Modules.
	
LONG DESCRIPTION
	I build a lot of PowerShell modules for various reasons and products. This
	module is my boilerplate for starting a new module.
	
	A module is an easly encapsulation for all CmdLets, variables, types and formatters. 

	All my modules have a manifest .PSD1 file, a .PSM1 file and one or more .PS1 files
	in the same directory: 

	- Each of these .PS1 usually contain only one advanced CmdLet function. In my
	  experience, working in a team on the module functions is easier when each 
	  function has its own .PS1 file. 
	- The PSD1 file (which is actually an hashtable) describes the module and
	  its properties.
	- The PSM1 file contains some scoped variables and some code to detect and
	  dotsource any or specific .PS1 files that exist in the same directory. 
	  While loading the module, the PSM1 code imports the .PS1 files into memory.
